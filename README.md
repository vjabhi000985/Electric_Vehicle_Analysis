# ðŸš—ðŸ”‹ Electric Vehicle Data Analysis - Washington State
## Overview:
This project analyzes the registration data of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in Washington State. The goal is to uncover trends, adoption dynamics, and provide insights into the growth of sustainable transportation through data visualizations like Choropleth maps and Racing Bar Plots.

## Objectives:
- EDA: Explore trends and patterns in electric vehicle registrations.
- Choropleth Map: Visualize EV distribution across locations.
- Racing Bar Plot: Animate the rise of EV makes over time.

## Requirements:
- Install the necessary libraries: `bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly`

## Workflows:
1. EDA: Analyze EV distribution, vehicle types, and geographic trends.
2. Choropleth Map: Visualize the geographic concentration of electric vehicles using Plotly.
3. Racing Bar Plot: Display the dynamic rise in EV makes over the years.

## Visualizations:
- Choropleth Map: Shows EV distribution across Washington State.
